Beer is brewed from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize(corn), and rice are also used. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In our resort you can order the best and strongest beers from around the world!",
